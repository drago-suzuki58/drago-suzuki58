# About Me

Hello there!  
I'm a hobbyist and intermediate programmer from Japan.

## Interests

### Game Development

I love games and I am interested in developing mods as well as creating games from scratch.

### Backend Development

I have an interest in server-side development and am learning to work with databases, APIs, and server management to build robust and scalable applications.

### AI

Artificial Intelligence fascinates me, and I enjoy experimenting with various AI tools and algorithms to solve complex problems.

### Reverse Engineering

I find it intriguing to deconstruct software to understand its inner workings. This curiosity drives me to analyze protocols, explore file formats, and understand system interoperability, not just in games but across various software domains.

### Modding

I am deeply passionate about extending and personalizing game experiences through modding. Modding is very deep, and what's appealing about it is that you can do anything you want if you put your mind to it.
